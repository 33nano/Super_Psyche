> Technology keeps getting smarter each year, but our brains do not. It's time to reverse that! Meet, SuperIntelligence Psyche, an application that helps humans of all walks of life to learn faster, improve their memory and change their lives. This application is inspired by multiple things and is by no means original. There is nothing new under the sun, but its possible to create something great by combining everything that is under it. This application uses information from a wide variety of sources not limited to Neurolinguistic Programming, Mental Models, Psychology, Neuroscience,Philosophy, Medical Journals and just about anything brain related. You are not stuck with the same brain you had yesterday and this application can prove it.
