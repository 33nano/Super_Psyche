 1. **What is Super Psyche?**
 - A gamified brain health application that utilizes the vast research available in Neuroscience to help users learn faster and achieve more. 

2. **Who is the target audience for Super Psyche?**
- Its for anyone who wants a better brain, if that's you, then this app is for you.

3. **Where will this application be available once its realeased?**

4. **When do you plan to release this application?**
- I am aiming for the year 2025, but its highly possible to build this app before then. 2025 is SMART goal (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time based)

5. **Why are you building this application in the first place?**
- I searched around the internet and i couldn't find the application that i was looking for. I found apps that were close to what i was looking for, but they were still lacking.
